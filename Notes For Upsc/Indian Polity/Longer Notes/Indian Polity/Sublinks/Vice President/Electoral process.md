# Electoral process of Vice president
Indirect election is done - same as president - By members of Both houses. But Electoral college is different
## Process
1. Includes both - elected and nominated member of #Parliament . In President - only elected member
2. Exclude member of state legislature - In President - elected member of State legislature included.
## Reason 
Reason for this given by #DR-Ambedkar 

#President - has to administer both the centre as well as state - Necessary - include state legislature.
#Vice-President - has to head the council of ministers in centre - deal with them - Only - temporary period - take up president position - on unavailability. So it - not necessary - include- state legislature

Process of election - same as that of president - Proportional representation - with secret ballot.
