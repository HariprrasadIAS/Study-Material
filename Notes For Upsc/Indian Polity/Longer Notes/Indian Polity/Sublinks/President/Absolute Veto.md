### Absolute Veto:
President - withhold his assent to the bill - the bill wont become a act. Happens for two reasons - 1. bill introduce by not a minister in #Parliament but a member. 2. Bill introduce by a cabinet - dissolved - new cabinet - advice not to pass the bill

In 1954 #Rajendra-Prasad president withheld his assent - [[PEPSU-Appropriation-Bill]] - which was passed - #President-Rule - Once revoked - again it is presented
1991 #R-Venkataraman withheld his assent - #salary-allowace of Member of parliament #amedement Bill. It is passed - before dissolution of #Lokh-Sabha - without obtaining the previous recommendation of the #President
