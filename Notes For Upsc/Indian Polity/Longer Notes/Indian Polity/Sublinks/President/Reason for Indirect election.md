### Reason for Indirect election:

1.  Electing president - harmony with the parliamentary system - President - nominal member - real power lies- #Council-of-Minister headed by #Prime-Minister . Unfair - elected president - by people - wont have any power.
2. Direct election - time consuming and costly - He just a symbolic head.

Some suggest - keep - election b/w both house of parliament. Not preferred - if - one political party dominated - elect who they want - wont be represent for state. Present system - president - equal to all.

Proportional representation - wrong - because - takes place - to fill two or more seats - president seat - one seat. Single vote - wrong - as voter can do as many there are.
