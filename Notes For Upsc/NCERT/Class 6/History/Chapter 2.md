## Hunter-Gatherers:
2 million years ago - subcontinent - #hunter-gatherers. They used to hunt wild animals and gather foods. They are always on movement - because 

1. they were in one place - all the resources will be used up.
2. animals they hunt are in movement - in search of their food.
3. plants and trees - bear fruits in different season - they have to move according to seasons.
4. civilization - found on the bank of rivers - some are perennial( ==water throughout year==) - some are not.

## Finding about fire:
#kurnool-caves traces of ash was found.
## Sites:
From 2 million years to 12000 years ago - #Palaleolithic - this covers 99% of human history.
From 12000 years to 10000 years ago - #mesolithic - climate changes happened - stone tools found are very tiny (==Microliths==)
From 10000 years - #Neolithic - relating to or denoting the later part of the Stone Age, when ground or polished stone weapons and implements prevailed.
## Change in climate:
About 12000 years ago there was change in climate relatively warmer. This helps grass to grow - increase in grass eating animals. This is time - wheat ,barley, rice are grown naturally - subcontinent. Learning about - how to plant - when they ripe - made them farmer.
People attract and tamed the animal - first tamed animal - ancestor of dog- later they were made near to  house - #hearders.
## Domestication:
Process of growing plants and animals. will be different from the wild one. Plants - yield in large number - strong stalk - are chosen. Animals - with small horns and teeth are preferred for domestication. started 12000 years ago - wheat and barely was earliest - sheep and goat was earliest.
## Making of pots:
To store the seed - made large clay pots - woven basket - dug pit in ground. Animal - storing as food.
## First farmer and herders:
Blue squares in map of evidence. show the first farmer and herders. Burnt grain was found -  important discovery. Huts and Houses are found. #Burzahom - pit is found - with steps leading downward - for  winter weather. some sites - cooking hearth - both inside and outside the house. Stone tools different from #Palaleolithic - from #Neolithic - polished to make fine cut
mortars (==small ammi==) and pestles(same as mortars). In #Neolithic - #Palaleolithic tools are also made. they were not stopped. started using pots - cooking and storing. started weaving clothes using cotton they grown.
## Mehrgarh
